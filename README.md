FarColorer
==========
FarColorer is a syntax highlighting plugin for Far Manager.
[![Build](https://github.com/colorer/FarColorer/actions/workflows/farcolorer-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/colorer/FarColorer/actions/workflows/farcolorer-ci.yml)

It only works for (F4)Edit file. (F3)View is not supported, as there is no API.
But you can type in the console `clr:name_of_file`. This launches the built-in viewer colorer.

How to build from source
==========
To build plugin from source, you will need:

  * Visual Studio 2019 or higher
  * git
  * cmake 3.15 or higher
  * vcpkg

Download the source from git repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/colorer/FarColorer.git --recursive
```

Setup vcpkg, or use the preset (set env VCPKG_ROOT)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
set VCPKG_ROOT=<path_to_vcpkg>
%VCPKG_ROOT%\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat -disableMetrics
```

#### IDE

Open folder with Colorer-library from IDE like as Clion, VSCode, VisualStudio.
In the CMakePresets file.json configurations have been created for standard builds.

#### Console

Setup Visual Studio environment (x64 or x86/arm64 for platforms)

```bash
"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64
```

Build colorer and dependency, if they are not in the local cache:

```bash

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -S .. -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=%VCPKG_ROOT%/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DCOLORER_BUILD_ARCH=x64
cmake --build .
```

For x86 platform use `-DCOLORER_BUILD_ARCH=x86`, arm64 - `-DCOLORER_BUILD_ARCH=arm64`.

Once built, the dependencies will be cached in the local cache.
